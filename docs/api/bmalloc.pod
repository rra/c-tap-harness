=head1 NAME

bmalloc, bcalloc, brealloc, bstrdup, bstrndup - Checked memory allocation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <tap/basic.h>

void *B<bmalloc>(size_t I<size>);

void *B<bcalloc>(size_t I<n>, size_t I<size>);

void *B<brealloc>(void *I<ptr>, size_t I<size>);

char *B<bstrdup>(const char *I<string>);

char *B<bstrndup>(const char *I<string>, size_t I<size>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions are wrappers around the standard C memory allocation
functions.  They each check whether the memory allocation succeeded,
returning the newly allocated memory on success and calling sysbail() on
failure.  They're intended for use inside TAP test cases where the test
case should be aborted if memory allocation fails, and avoid the need to
check each allocation as it's performed.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

bmalloc() and bcalloc() return a pointer to the newly allocated memory,
and brealloc() a pointer to the reallocated memory (which may or may not
be the same as I<ptr>), identical to their standard C counterparts.
bstrdup() returns a pointer to a newly allocated copy of I<string>.
bstrndup() does the same, but copies at most I<size> characters of
I<string> and always nul-terminates the returned string.  None of these
functions may return NULL; if memory allocation fails, they will abort the
program.

=head1 CAVEATS

bmalloc() and bcalloc() do not guard against allocating 0 bytes, just
calling the underlying C library functions, and may return NULL in that
case on some platforms.
