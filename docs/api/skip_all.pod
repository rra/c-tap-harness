skip_all - Tell a TAP harness that all of a test case is skipped

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <tap/basic.h>

void B<skip_all>(const char *I<format>, ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

skip_all() tells a TAP harness that all of a test case is being skipped.
I<format> may be NULL to give no reason; if I<format> is not NULL, it
should be a printf-style format string with optional following arguments
that explains the reason why the test case was skipped.  skip_all() will
print an output line like:

    1..0 # skip <reason>

and then exit with an exit status of 0.  skip_all() must be called before
plan() or plan_lazy(), since it presents an alternative plan to the TAP
test harness.

skip_all() should be used if prerequisites for a test case are not met and
it would be meaningless to run that test case (if, for example, optional
test configuration is not present, or if the test case only applies to a
particular platform).

=head1 RETURN VALUE

None.  skip_all() exits the program with an exit status of 0 when called.
